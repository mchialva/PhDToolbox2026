# Final Workshop
This is a practice-oriented course and you won't need to take any exams. However, beside completing the few homeworks we assigned [here](hhttps://mchialva.github.io/PhDToolbox2026/Exercises/) we ask you to develop your own project and to showcase it to your peers and teachers during the last Workshop session that will be held on February 2 2026 (09:00-12:00).

We do not ask you to develop a complex project, but a product which shows what you learned during the course. This activity will also allow you to consolidate and validate your knowledge, to develop your problem-solving skills, or highlights possible doubts about the faced topics with a "learning by doing" approach. If you wish, you can use your own data (if you already have any). If not, just look at our suggestions here below or look for your favourite dataset (not necessarily on biology).

You are warmly encouraged to use all the tools & topics faced during lessons. The use of different libraries, plot types and data wrangling functions will be very welcome. The activity should include the compilation of a reproducible data analysis report/presentation with Quarto/RMarkdown.

If you are a coding enthusiast you can develop your project alone, otherwise you can work in small groups with other students. Be creative!

>[!TIP]
> Don't wait till the end of the lessons to start developing your project, starting earlier during lessons allows you to progressively develop your ideas and to interact with us if needed.
