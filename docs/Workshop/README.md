# Final Workshop
This is a practice-oriented course and you won't need to take any exams. However, beside completing the few homeworks we assigned [here](https://github.com/mchialva/PhDToolbox2026/tree/main/docs/Exercises/signed here to Please complete the following exercises and load your final outputs in the opened Moodle tasks [here](moodle link) to show you acquired knowledge we ask you to develop your own real project and to showcase it to your peers and teachers during the last Workshop session that will be held on February 2, 09:00-12:00.

We do not ask you to develop a complex project, but a product which shows the skills you acquired about what you learned in the previous days. This will also allow you to consolidate and validate your knowledge, to develop your problem-solving skills, or highlights possible doubts about the faced topics. If you wish, you can use your own data (if you already have any). If not, just look at our suggestions here below or look for your favourite dataset (not necessarily on biology).

You are not required (but warmly encouraged!) to use all the tools & topics faced during lessons. This includes the compilation of reproducible data analysis report with Quarto/RMarkdown in the form you prefer.

If you are a coding enthusiast you can develop your project alone, otherwise you can work in small groups with other students. Be creative!

>[!TIP]
> Don't wait till the end of the lessons to start developing your project, starting earlier during the course period allows you to progressively develop your ideas and to interact with us if needed.
